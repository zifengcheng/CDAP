# Unifying Token and Span Level Supervisions for Few-Shot Sequence Labeling
Code of Our TOIS'23 Paper "Unifying Token and Span Level Supervisions for Few-Shot Sequence Labeling"


## Enviroment
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Dataset
```
mkdir data
cd data
```
### FewNERD
We use the latest sampled dataset from [FewNERD](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/0e38bd108d7b49808cc4/?dl=1), which corresponds to the results of [the 6-th version FewNERD paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.07464v6.pdf).
The new sampled data fixs the data sampling bug, see [issue](https://github.com/thunlp/Few-NERD/issues/15).

```
wget -O data.zip https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/0e38bd108d7b49808cc4/?dl=1
unzip data.zip
mv episode-data/* ./
rm -rf episide-data
```

### SNIPS and Cross-Dataset
We use the sampled data from [SNIPS-FewShot](https://atmahou.github.io/attachments/ACL2020data.zip).

```
wget https://atmahou.github.io/attachments/ACL2020data.zip
unzip ACL2020data.zip
mv ACL2020data/* ./
rm -rf ACL2020data
cd ..
```
